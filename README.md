# jEDI Master
jEDI Master is the EDI foundational base upon which our ERMS will be built.

# Overview
This project is currently in the planning stage. We are determining the best way to start moving forward on creating a system to retrieve Electronic Data Interchage (EDI) transmissions from external SFTP or FTPS servers, download the transmission file, parse the data out of the transmission file, move that data to Portable Document Format (PDF) files and to the back-end database server. Once the data has been extracted from the incoming EDI files, Functional Acknowledgment transmissions need to be sent back to the originator of the transmission that was just parsed. Furthermore, any other transmissions that are required to be sent will be processed and forwarded to the SFTP or FTPS server that is set up for handling the EDI transmissions. These additional transmissions may include sending invoices, purchase orders, payments or payment confirmation notices.

Currently, we are only targeting the manufacturing industry, but we will also be creating the EDI automation system for other industries in the future. These industries include:

* Banking
* Financial (stock/bond traders, financial advisors, investment planning, etc.)
* Insurance
* Logistics
* Medical
* Real Estate

Each of these industries relies to some degree upon EDI for B2B communications, as well as for purchasing, invoicing, Electronic Funds Transfers (EFT), etc. Our goal is to become the *defacto standard* for EDI/ERMS software in the future.

# Needs
Integrity Solutions is in need of 2 to 5 experienced Java/J2SE and NetBeans Platform developers for permanent, full-time positions with our company. Also, we are wanting to obtain at least 10 interns (unpaid and paid) to work on our project in order to gain experience in these technologies. For interns, we have no minimum skill requirements, other than the knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming paradigms and some understanding of the "Programmer's Algorithm."

Our starting pay for employee's is, unfortunately, a little low here in the start-up and planning phase. We are looking at paying a salary of $35,000.00 to $40,000.00 USD to begin, with pay increases in two years. However, we will also be offering medical/dental insurance, paid vacation, paid holidays and a retirement plan (401k, most likely). At the end of our initial start-up phase, which is defined by the first release of our base system, there will be the opportunity for bonuses that will be evenly split among the staff. These bonuses, however, are not guaranteed. For those who remain with Integrity Solutions beyond the initial release, there **will** be pay increases, because at that point, you will become Project Managers or Team Leaders.

# Requirements
For full-time employees, we would *prefer* that you would relocate to our area (Central Illinois, USA), but this is not required at the start. Interns and/or Contrators would not need to relocate and can work from wherever they are located.

Having said that, not relocating to Central Illinois is not a deal breaker, especially at this point in time. Our needs are too great right now to make relocation a deal breaker. At this point, we really just want to build the team and get our project moving forward.

If you are hired as an employee, once the two-year start-up period is complete and you want to stay on as a Project Manager or Team Leader, relocation will become a key issue. No sense in even worrying about that now, however, so let's move on.

# Contact Us
If you are interested in an internship, contract position or employment with Integrity Solutions, send an email to @SeanCarrick (PekinSOFT@outlook.com). The email will start the ball rolling on bringing you on-board. If you would rather just like to help out on this project because it seems interesting or challenging to you, send the email anyway. 

We look forward to hearing from you soon!

-The Integrity Solutions Team
