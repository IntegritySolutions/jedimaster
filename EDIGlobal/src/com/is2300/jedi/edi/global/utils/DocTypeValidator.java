/**
 * The <tt>DocTypeValidator</tt> API interface provides only one (1) public 
 * method, which needs to be overriden for the specific use of the program,
 * by which the various document type classes can perform validation on the 
 * document type codes provided to them through the incoming EDI file segment
 * data fields.
 * <p>
 * There are almost 1,000 different EDI document types, so this API provides an
 * <tt>Interface</tt> to allow a specific module to be able to create a
 * validation class for validating the provided EDI document types. EDI document
 * types are varied by industry:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>Banking</li>
 *  <li>Financial Services</li>
 *  <li>Insurance</li>
 *  <li>Legal Services</li>
 *  <li>Logistics</li>
 *  <li>Manufacturing</li>
 *  <li>Medical</li>
 *  <li>Real Estate</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Therefore, there are many different document types that need to be validated.
 * the <tt>validate()</tt> method examines the provided document type and 
 * determines whether or not it is a valid EDI document type.
